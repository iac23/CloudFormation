# CloudFormation and Terraform Project

This repository contains Infrastructure as Code (IaC) configurations using AWS CloudFormation and Terraform.

## Structure
- `CloudFormation/`: CloudFormation templates (`.yaml` files) for AWS resources.
- `Terraform/`: Terraform configurations for AWS resources.
- `Terraform_new_folder/`: Modular Terraform configurations with environments (development, production, staging).
## CloudFormation Repository\
This repository, serves as a central hub for managing AWS Infrastructure as Code (IaC). It includes:\
**CloudFormation Templates**: YAML files in the 'CloudFormation/' directory for provisioning AWS resources like EC2, RDS, S3 and VPC.\ 
**Terraform Configurations**: HCL files in the 'Terraform/' and 'Terraform_new_folder/' directories for managing additional AWS resources with modular and environment-specific setups.\
**Purpose**: Demonstrates my ability to design and deploy scalable, secure cloud infrastructure using IaC best practices.\
